# LLMs.txt for SuperBox (Frontend)


## Website Overview

SuperBox is a community-driven marketplace and playground for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It lets users discover, evaluate, and connect MCP servers to their AI agents, with optional premium gating and security insights.
This repository is the Next.js frontend for browsing servers, viewing details (including security reports), publishing listings, and testing interactions in a chat-style playground.


## Site Structure

- Home (`/`): Landing page with hero and curated carousels of free vs premium servers
- Explore (`/explore`): Full searchable/browsable catalog of MCP servers
- Server Detail (`/server/[id]`): Detailed view of a specific server, including tools, security reports, pricing, and connection instructions
- My Servers (`/my-servers`): Publisher dashboard to submit a new server listing (modal) and view example listings
- Playground (`/playground`): Chat-style demo UI intended to later interact with loaded MCP servers


## Key Features

- Server discovery with client-side search and categorization (free vs premium)
- Detailed server pages with tool lists and optional security reports (SonarQube, GitGuardian, Bandit)
- Copyable connection command and JSON config snippet for quick client setup
- Premium paywall via Razorpay (order creation and verification handled by backend endpoints)
- Publisher flow to submit new servers via a guided modal (POST to backend)
- Smooth animations and polished UI (Framer Motion, Tailwind)
- Next.js App Router with client components for fast interactions


## Data & API

- Base URL: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- Endpoints used by the frontend:
  - `GET /servers` → list servers (returns `{ total, servers: [...] }`)
  - `POST /servers` → create/publish a new server
  - `POST /payment/create-order` → create Razorpay order for premium servers
  - `POST /payment/verify-payment` → verify Razorpay payment
- Client-side mapping transforms API `ServerResponse` into UI-friendly server detail model for rendering.
